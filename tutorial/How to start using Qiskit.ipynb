    "- **Qiskit** <br/> Qiskit is an open-source framework for quantum computing. Provides tools to create, manipulate, and run quantum programs on prototype quantum devices in IBM Quantum Experience or on simulators on a local computer. The basic version of Qiskit uses the Python programming language. You can run programs on real quantum computers [here](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).\n",
    "- **Microsoft Quantum Development Kit** <br/> Microsoft QDK is a full-featured development kit for Q # that can be used with popular tools and languages to build quantum applications that can be run in a variety of environments. Q # programs can be run as a console application, or with Jupyter notebooks, or with a Python or .NET host program. To read more about Microsoft QDK click this [link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit).\n",
    "- **Project Q** <br/> ProjectQ is an open-source effort for quantum computing. This software allows users to implement their quantum programs in Python using a powerful and intuitive syntax. Next, it converts them to any type of back-end which later can be run on the classical simulators or quantum computers through IBM Quantum Experience. To read more about ProjectQ click [here](https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/ProjectQ)."

Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing. You can download it from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). We are going to be operating on the Anaconda's built-in console that can be found after installation by typing 'anaconda prompt' in the search bar. To check if installation was successful type this command."
