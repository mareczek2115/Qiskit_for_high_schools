### Do quantum computers exist and can I use one?
Contrary to appearances, many people do not even know that quantum computers exist. Of course, they can be found nowadays, mainly in laboratories, but some universities are already starting to acquire the devices in question for their purposes.

### Where are IBM quantum processors located?

IBM's quantum processors are located in a dilution refrigerator at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center which is the main headquarters of IBM Research (the largest industrial research organization in the world). It is is located close to New York in the US.

### What is IBM Cloud?

IBM Cloud is a set of cloud computing services for business offered by IBM. The platform scales and supports both small development teams and organizations, and large enterprise businesses. It is globally deployed across data centres around the world. IBM's main competitors in the cloud computing market include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. Through IBM Cloud you can access quantum computers with the IBM Quantum Experience service described below. These can also be accessed programmatically from your computer with Qiskit SDK. So far all you need to know is that Qiskit is an open source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits and algorithms. We will discuss it later on.

### IBM Quantum Experience - what is it?
IBM Quantum Experience is a web platform that provides users with access to IBM's prototype quantum processors through the use of quantum computing in the cloud. This service can be used to run algorithms and experiments. It also offers tutorials and simulations on the possibilities of quantum computing. Users interact with the quantum processor through a computational quantum circuit model by applying quantum gates on qubits via a graphical user interface called a **quantum composer**. You can run programs on real quantum computers [**here**](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).
